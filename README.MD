# 🌐 Aurxon Assignment Website (Next.js)

This is a fully responsive **website** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed as part of the interview process for **Aurxon Technologies**.

It includes company information, services offered, and an interactive inquiry form — enhanced with smooth animations, error handling, and professional UI practices.

# NOTE
I have added mock data in places like address, management persons, and images, etc. These can be easily configured as the code is very modular, and extensible.
